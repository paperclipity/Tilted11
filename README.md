# Tilted11
> **Turning Knobs for Success**
<br>

**Welcome** To The Official `GitHub` Repository for [Tilted11](https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/619771/unread/). <br>
Our **goal** is not to be the best `OS`, but to be the most unique.

*This* Repository contains things that help us decide what to implement next.
<br>

## About
**Tilted11** is a non-funded [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) OS. It is run on [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), coded on [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), and mainly discussed using [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/).<br>
We want to provide the best looks, while providing the best experience. <br>
It was founded on July 22, 2022, by @issac_the_scratcher and @EpicYesMe. The OS Started plain with not much, but was slowly developed into a great OS. <br>
With more members, we continue to develop an even more unique OS.

## What each section is for.
- [x] `Code` is for **coding**, it is not to be touched because we don't need that. 💻
- [x] `Issues` is the place to report **issues**. 🐛
- [x] `Pull Requests` is where you can discuss **merging** different repositories into one. We shouldn't need to that. ➡️
- [x] `Actions` is for making **GitHub** do stuff. No need to touch that. 🎬
- [x] `Projects` is for creating *projects** for each version to help us decide what to do. 📂
- [x] `Wiki` is for creating **Informational Pages**. ℹ️
- [x] `Security` is to make sure no **Evil Kumquats** eats this Repository. 🛡️
- [x] `Insights` is to make sure we are getting views. 📈
- [x] `Settings` is to let us change stuff.
